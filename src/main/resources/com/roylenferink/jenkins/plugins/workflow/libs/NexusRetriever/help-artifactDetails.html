    Define the artifact to download from Nexus, e.g.:<br>
    - <em>com.roylenferink:jenkins-shared-library:${library.jenkins-library.version}:zip:lib</em> will become <em>com.roylenferink:jenkins-shared-library:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT:zip:lib</em><br>
      This assumes the library is configured as 'jenkins-library'.
